A memory like game which does allow you to side load custom decks. This game was developed as a hobby, mostly for my son.
But feel free to test it out. The game can be played alone vs the AI or you can play against human players in a local coop mode.

The game is shipped with a build in deck, no need to create a custom one.

If you want to give it a try check it out on [Itch.io][itch-io]. You could also download the latest build on GitHub if you wish.
