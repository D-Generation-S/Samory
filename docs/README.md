# Samory

This is the manuel for the Samory.
It will list most information required to play the game.

## What is Samory

Samory is a memory game, the game was created as an digital memory game for my son.
The idea behind this was to allow me to use photos he did create with his camera or drawn himself
as images for a memory card. To do this and also allow me to share this game to you the game does allow to
side load custom images for the memory cards. This functiallity allows me to keep his images offline and
still use them in the game.

This mechanic also allows you, as a player, to create custom decks. Check the documentation down below
to learn how this works. It does contain some build in memory set's allowing you play the game without
creating a custom deck.
