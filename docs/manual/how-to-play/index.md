### How does a player turn look like

Check the [controls][controls] how to move and zoom the camera.
Pan around and zoom as needed. Select a card via one of the input methods and uncover it, select a second one and uncover it as well.

#### You found identical cards

If those cards are identical you will score a point and the cards will be removed from the game field.
Select another pair of cards, you can continue your turn until the cards do not match.

#### The cards are different

You need to press the `round end` button, or wait for n seconds. This automatic round end can be activated in the settings of the game.

If your selection does not match up your turn will end and the next player will be
highlighted in the left corner, now he can play.

### How to win

To win the game you need to find more matching pairs than any other players.
You will get an summary at the end of the game showing the points scored and announcing the winner.

The end screen does list the points each player has scored and does show the winner. It also allows you to replay the same deck with the same players or return to the main menu.
